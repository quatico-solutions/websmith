# websmith-core

This is an **internal module** for the websmith compiler. You most likely don't want to use this package directly. If you want to integrate websmith into your build process go to [@quatico/websmith-compiler](https://github.com/quatico-solutions/websmith/tree/develop/packages/compiler/README.md) for the compiler's CLI tool or to [@quatico/websmith-webpack](https://github.com/quatico-solutions/websmith/tree/develop/packages/webpack/README.md) for the webpack plugin.

Visit the [websmith github repository](https://github.com/quatico-solutions/websmith) for more information and examples.
