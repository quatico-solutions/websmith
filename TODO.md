# TODOS

- [ ] Add proper CLI interface
- [ ] Depict scope: injectStyles, generate-docs (mixins, properties), generate-snippets (scss, css), optimize CSS styles
- [ ] Picture compilation process w/ targets, transformers, plugins
- [ ] Describe API for AST Transformers

## Development

- [ ] Fix Warn / Error messages (diagnostic does not provide them in CLI mode)
- [ ] Reimplement Watch Mode (does not compile; watches files multiple times)
- [ ] Are we fine with the fact that without a `per target` configuration, the user is not able to control the `TargetConfig` as we do not have it available in the CompilationConfig for single target environments?

## Documentation

- [ ] Getting started with devDependencies etc
- [ ] CompilerConfig
- [ ] CompilationConfig
- [ ] TargetConfig and how to access it through AddonContext
